2. How to compile the code

You can open solution file PBO.sln with Visual Studio 2010.
Add where you store the openSEG library as an include directory. Part of the code also depends on Matlab library. 
So set include directory and library directory as follows if necessary and compile under Release or Debug mode.

D:\Program Files (x86)\MATLAB\R2009a\extern\include (replace with your Matlab path)
D:\Program Files (x86)\MATLAB\R2009a\extern\lib\win32\microsoft (replace with your Matlab path)
